if there are no songs
    show noSongsAlert state
        otherwise
            show songsList

                within songsList, 
                    if priorityButton is pushed
                        show only that priority group's songs
                            and if there are none, show nothing(null)

                            this likely requires current SongsList component to be refactored into an AllSongs file.
                            which will be drawn into a ternary statement for rendering against files for PriorityOneSongs, PriorityTwoSongs, etc.
