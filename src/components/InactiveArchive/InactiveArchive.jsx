// this component will more or less mirror SongsList
// i'll add a "inProgress" boolean to the songs table which will default true
// logic for switching boolean to false will be embedded in the archive button in SongDetails


//!!!

/// it would seem that a POST to a new endpoint would make sense
// but that probably isn't really necessary here.  these are all just songs, just differentiated by completion status
// so the finished archive just needs to conditionally render what's false
// while the songsList component might need to get updated to conditionally render what's true
// or the other way around if the boolean we use is "finished" - which makes the most sense, probably.
