*** Plan for Albums Feature ***

The value of this feature is less what the feature does for the user than what it eliminates.
As the app exists now, the user is given the choice of 4 priority tiers, because that's what I 
need in my personal usage of it.  For many users such a range would never come in to play.  Therefore,
letting the user add the song collection (or album) at the start, and then subsequently add songs and recordings to 
it allows them to control the scale at which they interact with the app.  Conditional rendering can then be built in 
that accurately reflects that scale - for example, the color code legend in songsList would not render if only one album 
(or priority tier, in the app's present state) has been inputted, but if two or more were present, each option would be shown
in that menu.

Ultimately, it's true that this is a long and better way of accomplishing something the app is kind of already doing 
with the distinct endpoints for different priority groups.  It reveals that the current solution is definitely a workaround with 
major shortcomings. It will be a huge pain, but all the conditional rendering of priority status can go away with this planned 



1. SQL query will create a new table for Albums 
    - The relationship of songs to albums will mirror the recordings-songs relationship
    - There could be a join which connects the priority designation of album and song
